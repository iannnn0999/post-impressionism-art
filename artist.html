                        <h2>Paul Cezanne</h2>
                        <p>Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) was a French Post-Impressionist painter often called the “father of modern art.” He bridged Impressionism and Cubism by using bold colors, geometric shapes, and structured brushstrokes. Cézanne is best known for his still lifes of fruit, landscapes of Provence, and portraits. His style influenced artists like Picasso and Matisse, helping shape 20th-century modern art.</p>

His most famous work, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, is a landmark in modern art and shows his scientific approach to color and light.</p>
